# 5G-QoERA An Integrated Dataset for QoE Assessment in 5G NR Based on User Mobility, Radio Map, Scheduling Decisions, and Application Details
This repository contains the 5G-QoERA dataset, designed to enable comprehensive Quality of Experience (QoE) assessments in 5G New Radio environments. The dataset integrates a variety of features such as user mobility, radio map environments, scheduling decisions, and application-level details, allowing researchers and developers to evaluate both QoE and Quality of Service (QoS) metrics in modern mobile networks.

## Abstract

Mobile networks through Beyond 5G and 6G are implementing a plethora of features to ensure the integration of new services. An in-depth study of the factors influencing users' Quality of Experience (QoE) can ensure the continuous availability of the network resources with an increasingly high Quality of Service (QoS).  
Many research activities have proposed datasets on different and separated aspects of the networks only focused on QoE and/or application-level aspects.
To advance the current state of the art, this paper presents 5G dataset for QoE assessment in new RAdio (5G-QoERA). It integrates user mobility, radio map environments, scheduling decisions, and application-level details for QoE assessment in 5G New Radio.
After detailing the dataset generation, a preliminary analysis of the features is conducted to underline the possible directions that can take advantage from the dataset usage.
